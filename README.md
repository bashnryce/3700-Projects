## Assignment Listing

The first assignment group is designed to teach Verilog syntax for Register Transfer Level
(RTL) design. You should plan to complete *approximately* one assignment per weekday.
Some will go faster than others; if you complete an assignment in under one hour, you
should continue working on the next assignment. For most students, the pace will slow in the 
the rtl_assignments group as the tasks become more complex. On average, you should plan 
about 1.5 weekdays per assignment in the rtl group. 

**How many hours per day?** Most students complete simple assignments within an hour, and more 
complex RTL assignments can vary widely since there are more opportunities to get stuck. Usually 
students can be successful when devoting at least **one hour per day, each day** to these assignments.
If you get stuck, it is crucial to **seek help quickly and often**, and if you fall behind, **put in 
extra time if possible to keep on schedule**. The course will be much more valuable if you keep up 
with the assignments so that you can understand the lectures.
